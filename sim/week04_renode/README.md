# Week 4 Renode (ARM) Demos

## Core Ideas

Building large systems requires extensive simulation.  Simulating a full CPU is extremely time consuming, so we need higher level tools.

### Emulation vs Simulation

- Verilog RTL: Simulation.  We simulate the Verilog code in software to see how the hardware would behave.  Examples include IVerilog, Verilator, Xilinx ISim etc.
- Hardware Emulation: Sometimes, the RTL simulation is too slow.  So we could speed it up by accelerating parts of this in hardware.  This is not exactly synthesis - we normally target FPGAs to partially synthesize and emulate the hardware behaviour, but are not targeting full timing closure and minimum area etc.  Examples include Synopsys Zebu, Cadence Palladium etc.
- Software/System Emulation: When we are trying to build a complete system, we want something that can "emulate" the hardware behaviour reasonably accurately, down to either the instruction set level, or even better to the cycle-accurate level.  These are typically called system emulators.  Examples include QEMU, Renode etc.

So here we are going to build a system emulation platform and run it using the renode tool, and demonstrate how we can run Linux on a system like this.  Later we will include the ability to co-simulate Verilog modules and build a system emulator that can also be used to test our hardware.

## Contents

### Bare Metal Demo
- Loosely based on the stock Renode vexpress-a9 platform and overlays:
  - CPU: Arm Cortex A9
  - RAM @ 0x8000_0000 (for the bare-metal ELF link address)
  - SmartTimer MMIO window @ 0x7000_0000 (size 0x1000)
- `bare/`: minimal bare-metal demo (sets EN, PERIOD, DUTY; pulses RST; clears STATUS).
- `week4_bare.resc`: Renode script to load the platform and run the bare-metal ELF.
- Ideally every access from the CPU to the AXI bus should be getting logged, but in practice if seems less reliable.
- Build: `make -C sim/week04_renode CROSS=arm-none-eabi-`
- Run: in Renode, `i @sim/week04_renode/week4_bare.resc`
  - Observe: `sysbus LogPeripheralAccess smarttimer` shows MMIO writes/reads reflecting W1P/W1C.

### Base Linux Demo

To boot Linux on a platform, we need several items:

- CPU + memory
- UART for seeing boot messages
- Linux kernel that has been compiled with knowledge of the peripherals (esp. UART)
- Ability to insert modules if needed

As a first cut, we will just go with the demo from Renode itself: this has been adapted to `sim/week04_renode/week4_linux_from_demo.resc`.  This just sets up a system, loads a kernel that has already been created by renode, and starts it.

The platform has a smarttimer peripheral attached, and we can examine this through `sysbus WhatIsAt 0x70000000`, but the kernel is not built with modules, so we cannot compile and run it.

### Linux Kernel Compilation

What is a kernel?  Essentially an executable file.  In fact, it basically looks like an ELF file, and needs to be loaded into an appropriate region of system memory.

Show the process of configuring a basic kernel:

- use the `multi_v7_defconfig` configuration as a generic ARM target
- add a custom command line so it will set up the console
- compile busybox and attach it to the kernel
- Compile and generate `vmlinux`.  Use `objdump` to examine this and see that it is also a general ELF file.

There are several steps here that need to be done in a very specific way:

- config of kernel
- config of busybox (turn off things like `tc` that throw compile errors)
- set up the initramfs include - this needs some very specific steps and the files need to be properly owned by root to work properly
- compile kernel to `vmlinux`
- compile to `zImage` if needed 
- set up renode platform with memory and redirects if needed - this is Zynq specific since traditional ARM kernels assumed a reset PC of 0xc0000000 or something like that, while Zynq systems tend to have DRAM at 0x0.  Depending on how we set up the platform, we may need to create a fake redirect like this.

### Linux Modules

- Set up the kernel as above.
- Cross-compile `sim/week04_mmio_demo/mmio_demo.c` for ARM (see that folderâ€™s README/Makefile; use Kbuild with `ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-`).
- Modify the initramfs setup by putting the `.ko` compiled output somewhere in it.  Then after boot use `insmod` to actually load and demonstrate it.

> Note: Week 5 will replace module params with Device Tree + `platform_driver` and `devm_ioremap_resource()`.

## Takeaways

- Emulation vs Simulation.  Why we need system emulators.  ISA, cycle accurate, co-simulation concepts
- Renode as a platform for emulation: basic setup with ARM and simple C code.  Examining memory contents, looking at the bus etc.  Power on reset and PC initialization.  Loading executable code into RAM.
- Booting stock Linux kernel on renode: UART for logging output.  Linux as just another executable.  Loading into specific part of RAM.  
- Compiling a custom kernel from base Linux source.  Configuration, command line parameters, initramfs
- Loading a module

## Compilation

### Busybox

Set up the variables for cross compilation

```
export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
```

Compile busybox

```
sudo rm -rf /tmp/initramfs
make -j$(nproc) CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- install CONFIG_PREFIX=/tmp/initramfs
```

Set up the `init` process


```
# Required device nodes
mkdir -p /tmp/initramfs/{bin,sbin,etc,proc,sys,dev,usr/bin}
cd /tmp/initramfs
sudo mknod -m 600 dev/console c 5 1
sudo mknod -m 666 dev/null    c 1 3

# Minimal /init
cat > /tmp/initramfs/init <<'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys
mount -t devtmpfs none /dev
echo "Userspace up; dropping to shell."
exec /bin/sh < /dev/console > /dev/console 2>&1
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/initramfs/init

# Make sure it is owned by root for correct permissions
sudo chown -R root\: /tmp/initramfs
```

### Linux

Should be done **after** busybox since it expects /tmp/initramfs to contain the data we need.  Copy over the `.config` as needed from the source.

```
# Instead of 4 you can use a higher number if you have more cores
make -j4
```
